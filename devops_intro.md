# DevOps?

Problem 1:
- Developers write code, in working / Dev environment
- Code works for them, passed on to Operations
- Ops cannot run app - different environments

- SOLUTION: Standardized environment <-- Virtual Machines, enter DevOps

Problem 2:
- Devlopers write code in large blocks
  - Takes time, creates large / sudden update
  - Any errors will be much harder to find

- SOLUTION: AGILE
  - Smaller, regular updates
  - Reduces feedback loop, easier to find errors (automated testing)
  - Faster updates



#### 4 Pillars of DevOps

2) Flexibility
  - Allows ability to evolve

3) Robustness
  - 100% uptime
  - Fast deployment
  - Strength / Reliability of Infrastructure

4) Cost
  - Cap-ex & Op-ex
  - Cost of downtime
  - Cost of slow innovation
  - Cost of time to market
  - Cost of infrastructure
